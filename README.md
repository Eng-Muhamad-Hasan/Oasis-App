# Expo Auth Starter

A production-ready Expo Router authentication starter using Better Auth, PostgreSQL, Drizzle, and Resend. It keeps navigation, product features, client integrations, and server security separate so providers can be replaced without rewriting screens.

Built by **Code with Nomi**.

## Included

- Email/password registration, verification, sign-in, logout, and two-step recovery
- Native Google sign-in on Android/iOS and Sign in with Apple on iOS
- Secure Better Auth sessions and protected Expo Router route groups
- Required unique-username onboarding with optional App Lock setup
- Account deletion with password or recent-session confirmation
- Optional biometric app lock and system/light/dark appearance
- Database-backed rate limiting, health checks, safe reporting, and tests

The product UI after authentication is intentionally small: one public resource and one private resource demonstrate how to build on the session.

## Stack

| Area | Reference choice |
|---|---|
| App and routing | Expo, React Native, TypeScript, Expo Router |
| Authentication | Better Auth |
| Database and ORM | PostgreSQL/Neon, Drizzle |
| Email | Resend |
| Server state | TanStack Query |
| Native identity | Nitro Google Sign-In, Expo Apple Authentication |
| Local app lock | Expo Local Authentication |

Neon, Drizzle, and Resend are replaceable server boundaries, not UI dependencies.

## Prerequisites

- Current Node.js LTS and npm
- Xcode for iOS and Android Studio/SDK for Android
- PostgreSQL database and Resend account
- Optional Google Cloud and Apple Developer accounts

Google, Apple, and biometrics require a native development build; Expo Go is not sufficient.

## Quick start

### 1. Install and choose the app identity

```sh
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `app-identity.json` before creating OAuth clients or native builds:

```json
{
  "name": "Expo Auth Starter",
  "slug": "expo-auth-starter",
  "scheme": "expoauthstarter",
  "iosBundleIdentifier": "com.example.expoauthstarter",
  "androidPackage": "com.example.expoauthstarter"
}
```

This single file supplies the product name, Expo slug, URL scheme, iOS bundle ID, and Android package throughout the project.

### 2. Configure the required environment

```dotenv
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host/database?sslmode=require
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=replace-with-at-least-32-random-characters
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:8081
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8081
EXPO_PUBLIC_APP_ENV=development
EMAIL_FROM=Expo Auth Starter <onboarding@resend.dev>
RESEND_API_KEY=re_replace_with_your_server_only_key
```

Generate the auth secret with `npx auth secret`. Only intentionally public build values use the `EXPO_PUBLIC_` prefix; database, auth, email, and OAuth secrets stay server-only.

### 3. Prepare the database and email

Create a Neon project or another PostgreSQL database, set `DATABASE_URL`, and apply the committed schema:

```sh
npm run db:migrate
```

Create a Resend API key and sender. The shared `onboarding@resend.dev` sender can normally email only the address associated with your Resend account; verify your own domain before testing other recipients or deploying.

### 4. Build and run

```sh
npm start
npm run ios
npm run android
```

Email/password works before Google or Apple is configured. Rebuild after changing native plugins, identifiers, entitlements, or OAuth configuration; restarting Metro is not enough.

### 5. Verify the setup

- Open `http://localhost:8081/api/health` and confirm the database is reachable.
- Register with a password of at least 15 characters.
- Enter the six-digit email code, choose a unique username, and optionally enable App Lock.
- Confirm public data works without a session and private data requires one.

## Environment reference

| Variable | When | Visibility |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Required | Server |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` | Required | Server |
| `BETTER_AUTH_URL` | Required | Server |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` | Required | Client |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_APP_ENV` | Required | Client |
| `EMAIL_FROM`, `RESEND_API_KEY` | Required | Server |
| `AUTH_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` | Additional browser origins | Server |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_*_CLIENT_ID` | Google | Client |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Google | Server |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | Optional signing selection | Build environment |

See `.env.example` for descriptions and placeholders.

## Native providers

### Google

Configure the OAuth consent screen and create Web, iOS, and Android OAuth clients in one Google Cloud project. The iOS client uses the bundle ID; Android uses the package and signing SHA-1; the Web client provides the server secret.

```dotenv
EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID=
EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID=
EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

All four values must be present. The client IDs are public; the client secret is not.

### Apple

Register the exact iOS bundle ID, enable **Sign in with Apple** for that App ID, and use normal Xcode/EAS signing. The native ID-token flow does not require a Service ID, web callback, `.p8` key, or Apple client secret.

Detailed setup, troubleshooting, and Apple deletion requirements are in [Provider setup](docs/providers.md).

## How it fits together

```text
app starts
  -> restore server session and local app-lock preference
  -> signed out: auth routes
  -> signed in but incomplete: onboarding
  -> signed in and complete: dashboard
  -> session request failed: retry screen
```

```text
feature -> client API -> app/api route -> server handler -> auth/database/email
```

`src/app` owns routes, `src/features` owns product behavior, `src/components` owns reusable UI, `src/lib` owns client integrations, and `src/server` owns secrets and privileged work. Route guards control navigation; every private API still validates the server session.

See [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) for route groups, module placement, adding protected features, and removing optional capabilities.

## Customization map

| Goal | Start here |
|---|---|
| Change name, scheme, or native IDs | `app-identity.json` |
| Change password limits | `src/constants/auth-policy.ts` |
| Change username/onboarding rules | `src/features/onboarding/onboarding-contract.ts`, `src/server/onboarding` |
| Change colors and UI primitives | `src/theme`, `src/components/ui` |
| Add a protected screen/API | [Architecture](docs/architecture.md#adding-a-protected-feature) |
| Add or change user fields | `src/constants/auth-user-fields.ts`, auth schema, migration |
| Replace Neon with PostgreSQL hosting | `src/server/db/index.ts` |
| Replace Drizzle with Prisma/another ORM | [Production](docs/production.md#database-and-orm-portability) |
| Replace Resend | `src/server/email/email-delivery.ts`, `src/server/env.ts` |
| Remove onboarding or biometrics | [Architecture](docs/architecture.md#optional-capabilities) |
| Remove Google or Apple | [Provider setup](docs/providers.md) |
| Replace Better Auth | `src/lib/auth`, `src/server/auth`, auth API route/provider |

Provider replacement should preserve the small application contract rather than changing every screen.

## API examples

| Endpoint | Access |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/health` | Public readiness |
| `/api/auth/*` | Better Auth operations |
| `GET /api/demo/public` | Public example |
| `GET /api/demo/protected` | Authenticated and onboarded |
| `PATCH /api/onboarding` | Authenticated unique-username completion |

The example buttons make these requests explicitly. The public demo works without a session and may be cached. The protected demo validates the Better Auth session and completed onboarding on the server, returns `401` or `403` when access is unavailable, and uses private `no-store` caching.

Remove the demo endpoints after real product resources replace them; keep the health endpoint.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |

## Before production

- Use HTTPS origins and unique secrets from a secret manager.
- Verify the Resend domain and apply reviewed migrations.
- Configure trusted proxy/IP behavior for database-backed rate limiting.
- Build with production environment values and test authentication on physical devices.
- Run the automated checks and client-secret audit command.
- Add Google Play's public account-deletion URL.
- Implement Apple authorization revocation before shipping Apple-linked deletion.

See [Production](docs/production.md) for session, deletion, observability, portability, and release details.
